Absolutely! Here's a `README.md` for the sample project, with clear explanations of how **Technical Credit (TC)** is used throughout the codebase:

---

```markdown
# 🛒 E-Commerce API (with Technical Credit Examples)

This is a minimal Flask-based e-commerce API designed to illustrate how **Technical Credit (TC)** can be embedded into small projects to ensure **long-term maintainability, scalability, and development speed**.

> 🧠 **Technical Credit** is the idea of making proactive, strategic technical decisions that require higher initial investment but yield significant benefits over time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular architecture with Flask Blueprints
- Versioned REST API
- OpenAPI specification for clear documentation
- App factory pattern for scalability and testability
- Automated tests with `pytest`

## ⚙️ Technical Credit Breakdown

| TC Element                 | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Modular Design**         | Each domain (e.g., products, orders) is implemented as a separate Flask blueprint. This promotes separation of concerns and makes scaling the codebase easier. |
| **Versioned API**          | Routes are exposed under `/api/v1/`, providing a clean strategy for future changes and backward compatibility. |
| **App Factory Pattern**    | The `create_app()` function allows for better testability and future enhancements like plugins, middlewares, or environment-based configs. |
| **Automated Testing**      | Pytest-based unit test ensures correct functionality and allows for safer future refactoring. |
| **OpenAPI Documentation**  | The `openapi.yaml` file enables external consumers (frontends, third parties) to understand and integrate with the API more easily. |
| **CI-Ready Structure**     | The structure is CI/CD-friendly with clear entry points for tests and linting. (Actual CI not included in this sample, but supported.) |

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. Access the API

Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/products/`

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

---

## 📄 API Documentation

The API is documented using the [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) format. View `openapi.yaml` in any OpenAPI-compatible UI like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

## 📚 Why Use Technical Credit?

While these decisions may seem excessive in small projects, they:

* **Pay off** as the project grows
* Reduce the cost of adding new features
* Make onboarding easier for new developers
* Improve code quality and team productivity
